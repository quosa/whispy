claude code web:

My intent is to do a simple application that has voice input (speech-to-text, I heard whisper.cpp is good); calls to either a local model (olllama or mlx) or an OpenAI API; and speaks the completion (text-to-speec, I heard that Piper might be good).

The main goal is for my kids to experience an "intelligent" computer system that they can interact with. English is ok, but French (and Finnish) would be great. The kids could ask some basic questions about their homework (ages 7 and 11), so most models should have the basics covered.

To start, I'd like a simple macos app that can even be a terminal app that just shows the input and response in text and uses the laptop mic and speaker for input and output.

Can you start by putting together a project plan with requirements, project phases and tasks, as well as quality criteria on how to test the e2e flow? Keep it simple and ask clarifying questions as needed.


# answering questions:

Push-to-talk vs. voice activity detection? I recommend starting with push-to-talk (hold spacebar). OK?
 - you can even start with always on if that helps, but pressing space bar to talk is fine
 - can you describe how difficult the voice detection will be of later phases?

Do you have Ollama installed? If so, which models?
 - yes, llama3.1 and qwen3, but I can download better models if you can recommend them

Do you have an OpenAI API key? Or should we treat cloud as optional for now?
 - not yet, we can start with a local model
 - I actually have a z.ai API (coder) key that we can use as well (later)
Finnish TTS — Piper's Finnish voice options are limited. Is French + English enough for v1?

Dependency management — any preference? I'd suggest uv.
 - haven used uv yet, but you picked python sot that'll be ok (good to learn anyway)

Apple Silicon or Intel Mac? Affects whisper.cpp acceleration and Ollama performance.
 - apple silicon, M4 mbp with 64GB

# definitive naswer to finnish:

Finnish TTS — you didn't answer this one directly. Piper's Finnish voices are limited. Options:

Accept lower-quality eSpeak for Finnish speech output
Finnish STT only (kids speak Finnish, assistant replies in English/French)
Cloud TTS for Finnish (breaks offline capability)
What's your preference? Or should we just skip Finnish TTS for v1 and see how it goes?

 - we can start with just english and french - let's postpone Finnish for later iterations

# read the project plan and good to start:

Yes, the plan looks solid, please start implementing the project!
